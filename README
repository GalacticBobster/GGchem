Fast thermo-chemical equilibrium code with or without 
equilibrium condensation down to 100K. 

Many thanks to the following St Andrews' students:
George Turner, Glen Hunter, Megan Worters, Drew Millard.

---------------------------------------------------------
To checkout the git repository and compile the code, use 

> git clone https://github.com/pw31/GGchem
> cd GGchem/src16
> cp makefile.prodimo makefile
> make

The makefile.prodimo is for ifort compiler, adjust your
own makfile if you want to compile e.g. with gfortran.

---------------------------------------------------------
To run the code, type

> cd ..
> ./ggchem16

It will create the output file "Static_Conc.dat", which
contains all computed molecular, atom and ion particle 
densities, the electron density, solid and liquid 
particle densities, and supersaturation ratios.

---------------------------------------------------------
To visualise the results, use e.g.

> python Plot_T.py
> evince ggchem.pdf

---------------------------------------------------------
Customize main.f and e.g. demo_sweep.f in folder src16 
to tell GGchem what it should do, e.g. set pressure and 
temperature range for a linear track in (logp, logT) 
parameter space.

Change init.f to use different element abundances. The 
default are solar abundances from Asplund et al.(2009). 
There are additional pre-installed options to use data from 
"Abundances.dat", including "EarthCrust", "Ocean" and 
"Meteorites".

---------------------------------------------------------
Select or deselect elements by modifying the first line 
of "dispol_new.dat", default choice is 
"H He C N O Na Mg Si Fe Al Ca Ti S Cl K Li el",
where "el" means to include atomic and molecular ions,
and the electron density as well, assuming charge equilibrium. 
Molecules listed below are included if they are made 
of the selected elements, otherwise they will be ignored. 

---------------------------------------------------------
If you want to switch on equilibrium condensation,
call EQUIL_COND() before GGCHEM(), see e.g. demo_sweep.f.
In that mode, the code will be much slower, and also
possibly unstable. Always start from large T and then 
lower T SLOWLY with successive calls. The code will create 
and expand "database.dat" automatically from the results 
of every successful call, such that once you have filled 
in the (p,T)-plane with many points, the results will be 
faster and more reliable.

---------------------------------------------------------
The pure gas phase chemistry needs about 0.2 ms per call
for T > 700 K (real*8 version) and about 2 ms per call 
for T < 700 K (real*16 version). 

The equilibrium condensation code requires many calls 
of the gas-phase equilibrium chemistry routine, and 
takes about 0.1 sec per point.
